Wiimote Canvas
==============

This is a Processing-based project created with the goal of expanding a custom drawing canvas functionality to include Wiimote input. 

The system will build upon a classic mouse-based drawing canvas by allowing the user to interact with the canvas using the Wiimote.  Drawing will be done through a cursor-based system controlled by the wiimote and wii sensor bar.  System will be expanded by allowing the user to manipulate drawing objects through various gestures and shape recognition to allow a smoother drawing experience for the user.
